This widget makes it easy for your site users to drill down into your Wordpress custom-post taxonomies.

== Description ==

Turn your Wordpress custom-post taxonomies into a search powerhouse! This plugin gives you the ability to provide your users with a widget full of dropdowns based upon parent terms (criterias) and their sub-terms (options).

For example, if you have multiple countrie terms in a country parent term, you can search throw custom-post by selecting one of the countries.

You can use this plugin as a widget or in a content with a shortcode.

= Features =
* Custom post choice
* Taxonomy choice
* Terms selection (parents/criterias and children/options), can manually sort them
* Automatic addition of the new terms/options in the selection, or not, with alphabetical re-ordering or not
* Simple or multiple selection
* Narrow search (all of the criterias) or broaden search (any of the criterias)
* Let the user choose the search type
* Ordering of results by default or by title
* Generates complete URL
* Does a proper URL-Rewrite if permalinks are enabled
* Pagination
* Search without selection : display all or do nothing
* Can hide empty terms (ie: without related custom-posts)
* If the empty terms are hidden and after a narrow search, disable terms which give no results if added to the previous search
* The results are displayed as custom-post archive
* Can use jQuery plugin Select2 or not
* Can use a shortcode
